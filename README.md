# Arbitrage Trading System

## Overview
An automated arbitrage trading system that monitors token prices across multiple RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls), identifies profitable opportunities, and executes trades automatically. The system uses WebSocket connections for real-time price monitoring and includes comprehensive trade management and notification features.

## System Objectives
- Monitor token prices across multiple RPCs in real-time
- Identify price differences that present profitable arbitrage opportunities
- Execute automated trades when profitable opportunities arise
- Maintain system health and stability
- Track and record all trading activities
- Provide real-time monitoring and reporting capabilities

## Core Features

### Price Monitoring
- Real-time price monitoring via WebSocket connections
- Dynamic RPC and token management through configuration files
- Automated health checks for RPC connections
- Price update interval: configurable from 1 to 10 seconds
- Returns "N/A" for unavailable prices
- No price storage in database (only real-time processing)

### Trading Engine
- Fully automated trade execution
- Trades with 10% of total available assets
- Profit calculation including transaction costs
- Single trade execution at a time (highest profit opportunity)
- Automatic slippage optimization
- Transaction nonce management
- Gas price optimization

### Configuration Management
- Dynamic RPC configuration without server restart
- Dynamic token list management without server restart
- Environment-based private key management
- System parameters configuration

## Technical Requirements

### RPC Management
#### Configuration Structure
typescript
interface RPCConfig {
url: string;
wsUrl: string;
network: string;
chainId: number;
name: string;
isActive: boolean;
}
- Health check system for RPC availability
- Automatic failover for inactive RPCs
- Transaction capability verification

### Token Management
#### Configuration Structure
typescript
interface TokenConfig {
address: string;
symbol: string;
decimals: number;
name: string;
isActive: boolean;
minTradeAmount: number;
maxTradeAmount: number;
}

### Database Schema
#### Trade Records
typescript
interface Trade {
id: string;
timestamp: Date;
tokenAddress: string;
tokenSymbol: string;
buyAmount: number;
buyPrice: number;
buyRPC: string;
sellAmount: number;
sellPrice: number;
sellRPC: string;
status: 'SUCCESS' | 'FAILED';
buyTxHash: string;
sellTxHash: string;
profit: number;
gasCost: number;
netProfit: number;
errorMessage?: string;
}
### API Endpoints
All responses in JSON format

#### Price Monitoring
- GET /api/prices/current - Current prices across all RPCs
- GET /api/prices/opportunities - Current arbitrage opportunities

#### Trading
- GET /api/trades - Trade history with filtering
- GET /api/trades/:id - Specific trade details
- GET /api/status - System status and statistics

#### System Management
- GET /api/system/health - System health status
- GET /api/system/rpcs - RPC status
- GET /api/system/tokens - Token list and status

### Security Considerations
- Private key storage in env file
- No sensitive data storage in database
- Rate limiting for APIs
- Input validation for all parameters
- Secure WebSocket connections
- Transaction signing security

### Monitoring & Notifications
- Telegram notifications for:
  - Successful trades
  - Failed trades
  - System errors
  - RPC status changes
- System health monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking

### Frontend Requirements
- Real-time price display via WebSocket
- Trade history with filtering capabilities
- System status dashboard
- RPC status monitoring
- Token price comparisons
- Profit/loss tracking

## Operational Workflow
1. System startup and configuration loading
2. RPC health verification
3. WebSocket connections establishment
4. Price monitoring initiation
5. Opportunity identification
6. Trade execution
7. Transaction monitoring
8. Result recording
9. Notification dispatch

## Performance Considerations
- Maximum response time for price updates: 1 second
- Maximum trade execution time: 3 seconds
- System uptime target: 99.9%
- Maximum CPU usage: 80%
- Maximum memory usage: 2GB

## Error Handling
- RPC connection failures
- WebSocket disconnections
- Transaction failures
- Price feed issues
- Network congestion
- Insufficient funds
- Invalid configurations

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-token arbitrage
- Cross-chain arbitrage
- Machine learning for profit optimization
- Advanced risk management
- Additional notification channels
- Enhanced reporting capabilities
